# Elyx_Hackathon_Submission_Radha_Kabir
This repository contains the code for our Elyx Hackathon submission, which comprises of a code to generate a WhatsApp-style conversation between a user/member and the Elyx team. It will also generate the analysis and summary of the conversation below the conversational text. The member starts the chat with an irritated and sleep-deprived tone of conversation, and by the end of the treatment, his sleep cycle was better, nutrition intake was proper and was also maintaining his fitness.

To run this, create a folder (say Elyx_Hackathon), and create 2 files: simulate.py and app.py within it, and copy the respective codes into them. Also create another folder named 'data' and within that create 'config_member.json' file, and copy the respective code. After that type the following into the terminal:

pip install streamlit pandas
python simulate.py
streamlit run app.py (in 3 different lines)

This should open the streamlit web page display with the output
> We have also attached the sample output (PDF File) of our code with the name 'medic_web_interface_'. This contains the entire conversation that the member had with the Elyx team.
